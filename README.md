# Password Generator

## Description

For this project I had to write the JavaScript side of a password generator. This tests my skills with a potential scenario of needing to create an application for an employee. This runs fully in the browser and has options the user can pick and choose. In the process of creating this it really cemented some fundamentals of JavaScript and the importance of the console to help with troubleshooting. As well as the importance of having clear comments and with having some pseudocode to start.

## Installation

No installation steps needed

## Usage

To use this app the user simply needs to go to the webpage and click the generate password button. After that prompts will show up directing the user on a number of options needed for creating a successful password. 
They are prompted with Length (8-128), and then to include Lowercase, Uppercase, Numbers and/or Symbols.
Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.
